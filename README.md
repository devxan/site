Originally hosted and primarily built with [Carrd.co](https://carrd.co), then exported when my subscription ran out. Files were manually uploaded onto [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), but I realize uploading it to a git server would be a lot smarter. Uses Google Analytics for some reason. 

Motivation for finally updating it: the /now page hadn't been updated for months 💀 and socials needed to be updated!
