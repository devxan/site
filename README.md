Copyright Xan Surnamehere!! (soon a permissive license for the code? maybe a CC one)

Originally hosted and primarily built with [Carrd.co](https://carrd.co), then exported when my subscription ran out. Repo was manually uploaded to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), but I realized uploading it to a git server would be a lot smarter. 

Uses Google Analytics for some reason. (Also has ALL of Carrd's social icons from export? omg it's so developer friendly ðŸ¥°)

Motivation for finally updating it: the /now page hadn't been updated for months ðŸ’€ and socials needed to be updated!
The reason it took so long to appear on GitHub: Cloudflare Pages and my GitHub account weren't correctly linked together.
